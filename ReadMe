Explanation behind code:


If head refers to the list of nodes 1→ 2 → 3 → NULL

The numbers shown are the node numbers, not their data values. There is no cycle in this list so return 0.

head refers to the list of nodes 1→ 2 → 3 → 1→ NULL There is a cycle where node 3 points back to node 1, so return 1.

Function Description of the has_cycle function.

It has the following parameter:

• SinglyLinkedListNode pointer head: a reference to the head of the list

Returns

• int: 1 if there is a cycle or 0 if there is not

Within the function:

1. Let the slow and fast both equal to head

2. While slow != NULL and fast != NULL and fast->next != NULL

• slow=slow->next;

• fast=fast->next->next;

• if slow==fast then return 1

3. return 0
